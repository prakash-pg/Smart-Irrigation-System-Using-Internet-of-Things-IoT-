# Smart-Irrigation-System-Using-Internet-of-Things-IoT-

The project involves developing an IoT-based smart irrigation system that uses DHT11, Soil Moisture, and
Rain sensors to monitor the water requirements of crops and trigger irrigation automatically when
needed. The collected data is transmitted to the cloud through an ESP8266 Node MCU module for
remote monitoring, and farmers can view the sensed data on a mobile application. This can help
optimize irrigation and improve crop yield while reducing water waste.
